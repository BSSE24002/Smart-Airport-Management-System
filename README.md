# ✈️ Smart Airport Management System

The **Smart Airport Management System** is a command-line based airport operations simulation built using advanced **Data Structures and Algorithms in C++**.

It models a real-world airport ecosystem where air traffic control, passenger management, baggage handling, and ground services interact using optimized algorithmic logic.

This project demonstrates how complex systems can be designed using efficient data structures to solve real-world logistical problems.
